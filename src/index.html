            <h1>A review of HTML</h1>
            <p>HTML is really a very simple coding language. It consists of ordinary text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">"characters.</p>
            <p>The best part about HTML is that once we know how to effectively use basic elements, we can look up how to use all of the others!</p>

        <u><h3>Lists</h3></u>
        <p>Below is an example of a nested-list, using both and ordered list and an unordered list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>first</li>
            <li>second</li>
            <li>third</li>

                <li>tres</li>

        <u><h3>Links</h3></u>
        <p>Links are very useful, and help users quickly navigate to new pages, both within and outside of the current website.</p>
        <p>
            For instance, they can quickly direct users to
            <a href="https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on" target="_blank">Google's Homepage.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="mailto:Jrabina@student.mamkschools.org">Emails</a>
            can also be sent through the use of links.
        </p>

    <u><h3>Images</h3></u>
    <img src="images/Mamaroneck logo.jpeg" alt="Mamaroneck logo" title="This is a mamaroneck logo" align="left" />
    <p>
        Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align" attribute, with a value of "left" is a <br />
        perfect way to do this. You could also align the picture to the right of the text by replacing the value in the "align" attribute to the "right".
